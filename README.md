🚀 Student Performance EDA Project
👋 Hi, I’m Hari (@myworkspace17)!
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about data analysis and visualization. In this project, I demonstrate my expertise in Python for data cleaning, data manipulation, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), to explore a dataset of student performance.

🧠 About Me
I’m Hari, a Data Analyst with experience in Python for data analysis and visualization. My goal is to transform raw data into actionable insights to help businesses and institutions optimize their performance and drive growth. This project demonstrates my skills in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and insights generation using Python.

🚀 About the Project: Student Performance EDA
The objective of this project is to explore a dataset of student performance, clean and manipulate the data, and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand various factors affecting academic performance. The project involves analyzing different aspects like study habits, parental involvement, age, and gender, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.

🛠️ Tools Used
Python Libraries:
Pandas: For data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
NumPy: For numerical operations and array manipulation.
Scikit-learn: (If required) for any feature engineering or modeling.
Jupyter Notebooks: For interactive analysis and documentation.
📝 Procedure Followed
Step 1: Data Loading
Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame for analysis.
Step 2: Data Cleaning
Check for Missing Values: Identify and handle missing values using appropriate methods.
Remove Duplicate Rows: Eliminate duplicate entries to ensure data accuracy.
Convert Data Types: Ensure that columns are of the correct data type (e.g., categorical columns should be converted to category type, date columns to datetime).
Outlier Detection: Identify and remove outliers using statistical methods.
Step 3: Data Manipulation
Feature Engineering: Create new columns based on existing ones.
Encode Categorical Variables: Convert categorical variables into numerical values using methods like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Create Additional Features: Derive new features that may help in further analysis.
Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Descriptive Statistics: Generate basic statistics (mean, median, mode, etc.) to get an overview of the data distribution.
Data Visualization: Use visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and bar charts to identify patterns and trends in the data.
Correlation Analysis: Analyze the correlation between numerical features using a correlation matrix.
Categorical Data Analysis: Visualize the distribution of categorical data using appropriate plots.
Feature Interaction: Visualize how different features interact with each other.
Step 5: Summary and Recommendations
Tailor learning interventions based on the analysis of student performance data.
Offer personalized support to students in need of improvement.
Provide strategies for improving time management and parental involvement.
